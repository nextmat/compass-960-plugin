960 Grid System - Compass Plugin
================================

960.gs is created by Nathan Smith. See the official site for more info: <http://960.gs/>

* This plugin is consistent with latest version of 960.gs as of 3/14/2011

---------

This plugin adds the 960 Grid System framework to [Compass](http://compass-style.org/).

Install
=======

    gem install compass-960-plugin

Create a 960-based Compass Project
==================================

    compass create -r ninesixty my_project --using 960

Or, If you prefer to use Sass's indentation based syntax:

    compass create -r ninesixty my_project --using 960 --syntax sass

Then edit your `grid.sass` and `text.sass` files accordingly. A reset is added into grid.sass automatically.

Customizing your Grid System
============================

This plugin uses the following configuration variables:

* `$ninesixty-columns` (default: 12) controls the default number of grid columns
* `$ninesixty-grid-width` (default: 960px) controls the default overall grid width
* `$ninesixty-gutter-width` (default: 20px) controls the default gutter width
* `$ninesixty-class-separator` (default: '_') sets the word separator for classnames generated by +grid-system

All of the mixins included with this plugin use these configuration variables
as defaults if the corresponding argument is omitted from a mixin call.

Class-Based Grid System
=======================

To create a grid system that works like the original 960 Grid System framework
use the `+grid-system` mixin to generate the corresponding classes. You can
also customize the number of columns as demonstrated in the following example.

Example:

    #wrap
      +grid-system(24)

Making Semantic Grids
=====================

To create a grid system using only CSS, use the following semantic grid mixins:

* Use the `+grid-container` mixin to declare your container element.
* Use the `+grid(N, columns, gutter-width)` mixin to declare a grid element.
* Use the `+alpha` and `+omega` mixins to declare the first and last grid elements for a row.
* Use the `+grid-prefix(N, columns)` and `+grid-suffix(N, columns)` mixins to add empty grid columns before or after a grid element.
* Use the `+grid-push(N, columns)` and `+grid-pull(N, columns)` mixins to move a grid element from its default position.

`N` is the number of grid columns to span as in `grid_N` or `push_N` with the original 960 Grid System framework.

Example:

    $ninesixty-columns: 16

    #wrap
      +grid-container
      #header
        +grid(16)
      #middle
        +grid(16)
        #left-nav
          +grid(5)
          +alpha
        #main-content
          +grid-prefix(1)
          +grid(10)
          +omega
